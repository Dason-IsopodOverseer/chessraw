The PLAN IS SIMPLE:
- Get server.js working with Mrs.Wear's code and impelement env key hiding.
- Get rules working and find a way to retrieve fen directly from game. Make a static single player mode.

NEXT, IMPLEMENT VOICE COMMANDS 
- Get google voice asynchronous command working.
- Will likely take a long time.

MULTIPLAYER MODE WITH FIREBASE.
- Set up a new firebase console for the game
- Use tic tac toe firebase to transmit fen between users
- Impelement game rooms.
